Hi,

I'm Bastien, an Office and Azure consultant from Nantes (France).

I work at [Gest'Innov](https://solution-de-gestion.fr/), a french ISV in the Microsoft ecosystem, with Dyanmics 365, Office 365 and Azure.

I'm very enthusiast about subjects like industrializing development, build and deployment processes to focus on real business values.
To achieve all that, I'm using the most of Azure DevOps and Azure features to involve business teams into the value of their products.

I blog here to share thoughts, feedbacks, discoveries and news about the ecosystem I work with every day.

Fell free to talk with me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/BastienPerdriau) and on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/BastienPerdriau).
